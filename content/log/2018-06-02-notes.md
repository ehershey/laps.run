I think I need to measure track straightaways. Two core measurements from which all else can be determined.

1. Measure Straightaway length. Deduce turn length.
2. Measure turn “diameter”. Compute turn length
3. compare turn length from 1 and 2. If same, single radius track. If different, likely double bend.
4. Attempt to determine which double bend dimensions

We’ll revisit a handful of tracks in a derivative sheet to test

Taxonomies
Country
Track color
Track surface
Lanes
Lanes lap
Steeple water location

New field: heading/direction of home straight

How to retire a track? List views hide tracks with retired: true. But still have a taxonomy or tag page for retired.

Calculators/generators
* arithmetic from my spreadsheets based on inputs: turn diameter, straightaway length
* yaml generator with same inputs.
* Pull request creator using GitHub oauth
* elevation lookup
